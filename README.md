# Keggle PUBG Player Archetypes
A player archetype analysis of the PUBG dataset (from Keggle) using High Densinty Clustering (hdbscan)

This is a project made with python for a course in Data Mining. We used data from the game Playerunknown's Battlegrounds provided by [keggle](https://www.kaggle.com/skihikingkevin/pubg-match-deaths).

We use unsupervised learning techniques to extract player archetypes and compare the used techniques. The report can be found in the root folder.
