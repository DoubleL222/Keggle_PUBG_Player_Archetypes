The hdbscan Clustering Library
==============================

The hdbscan library is a suite of tools to use unsupervised learning to find clusters, or
dense regions, of a dataset. The primary algorithm is HDBSCAN* as proposed by Campello,
Moulavi, and Sander. The library provides a high performance implementation of this algorithm,
along with tools for analysing the resulting clustering.
